A tiny yet useful MVC framework.<br />Useful for those creating a small project but don't want the full horsepower that is Zend Framework, CakePHP, CodeIgniter, etc.
<p>
<p>
In fact, this is what I use for small projects.<br />
You know what they say - the best way to learn MVC patterns is to create a framework yourself. 
</p>
<p>
So here it is. My tiny MVC framework.<br />
Comes with 3 examples - the index, contact, and error 404 pages.
</p>

<p>
It got its name, <strong>SUB100</strong>, because the initial release is under 100KB. 73KB to be exact.
